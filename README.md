## Implimentation
1. SearchComponent: I have made this component a client side component as there are intreactive elements to it such as Input field and Click events, And implimented Search API in this component as per the result of users input. Result is shown in a simple popup table as shown in the official website

2. GraphComponent: I have used ChartJS for this component where i am rendering the graph with the history of the companies performance using the queryParameters i am passing in the url. 

3. Filter component that allows users to see weekly, monthly and yearly performance in the canvas in a visualaized mannar. 

4. Add Meta Tags for better SEO and top search result. 

## 
I have made sure i use SSR extensively as Nextjs is know for its SSR and SEO properties. 


I have kept the stying simple and responsive.


Made sure to optomize code as much as possible.
